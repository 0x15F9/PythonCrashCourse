My attemps at try-it-yourselves and other challenges from the book.

## Final Thoughts:

### Pros
+ Great book for returning python programmers as well as newcomers
+ Stands up to its names as a Crash Course
+ Nice overall structure

### Cons
- Some stuffs are outdated (eg: pyGal v2 is out as well as Django 2)
